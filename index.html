            <p>The northeast monsoon has arrived four days early, triggering intense rainfall across Tamil Nadu. With all 13 shutters of the Mullaperiyar Dam open, floodwaters are surging into Theni and surrounding districts. Overlapping monsoons from Kerala and Tamil Nadu are amplifying the risk, flooding farmlands, homes, and roads. Experts warn that excess rain is no longer a blessing in a changing climate. Urban flooding, crop damage, and infrastructure stress are rising, highlighting the urgent need for better water management.</p>
